\item [(d)] \
\begin{itemize}
  \item We select the angle $\theta$ that maximizes the \textbf{NCC (Normalized Cross-Correlation)}. According to the plot, NCC peaks at $\theta = 45.0^\circ$, but this is evidently not the correct rotation angle. Although there is a local maximum at $-29^\circ$, it is not the global maximum. This suggests that NCC may not be a reliable measure for all types of image alignment.
  \item We choose the angle $\theta$ that minimizes \textbf{JE (joint energy)}. The plot indicates that the minimum of JE occurs at $\theta = -29^\circ$, which is close to the expected value. Given that the initial rotation was 28.5째 (with counterclockwise as positive) and the step size for $\theta$ is 1째, we have determined the answer with a precision of up to 1 degree.
  \item  We select the angle $\theta$ that maximizes \textbf{QMI (Quadratic Mutual Information)}. According to the plot, the maximum of QMI occurs at $\theta = -29^\circ$, which is near the expected value. Given that the initial rotation was 28.5째 (with counterclockwise as positive) and the step size for $\theta$ is 1째, we achieved a precision of up to 1 degree in our result
\end{itemize}

\item [(e)] \
The optimal rotation according to JE, is $-29^\circ$.

\item [(f)] \
When two random variables, \( I_1 \) and \( I_2 \), are independent, their joint probability distribution \( P_{I_1, I_2}(i_1, i_2) \) equals the product of their marginal distributions \( P_{I_1}(i_1) \) and \( P_{I_2}(i_2) \):

\[
P_{I_1, I_2}(i_1, i_2) = P_{I_1}(i_1) P_{I_2}(i_2).
\]

Thus, the greater the magnitude of the difference between \( P_{I_1, I_2}(i_1, i_2) \) and \( P_{I_1}(i_1) P_{I_2}(i_2) \), the stronger the dependence between the variables. Consequently, the images are more dependent (or correlated) when the QMI, given by

\[
\text{QMI} = \sum_{i_1} \sum_{i_2} \left( P_{I_1, I_2}(i_1, i_2) - P_{I_1}(i_1) P_{I_2}(i_2) \right)^2,
\]

is larger. Therefore, image alignment is achieved when their QMI is maximized.
